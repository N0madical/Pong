# Pong
First released on November 29, 1972 and made using the truly classic coding language of no coding language, pong is known as the ancestor of most arcade games

It also happens to be a pretty common game to make for those just starting with Pygame in Python!

However, you could say I got a little carried away because I've been taking Physics class for a semester now and I wanted to put some of my Physics knoweldge to use

So behold! Pong but with tons of customizibility and real life physics (minus the gravity and air resistance)

## Running Pong

I have yet to compile my version of Pong into an exe file yet, so Python is needed to run it

> To install Python, visit: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Once Python is installed, you'll need to install Pygame for it to run

To install Pygame, follow the instructions below:

 - Windows: Open `Command Prompt` and run `pip install Pygame`
 
 - MacOS: Open `Terminal` and run `pip install Pygame`
 
 Then download the Pong source code from this Git and extract it, then run `main.py`
 
 If you notice any errors, feel free to let me know!
